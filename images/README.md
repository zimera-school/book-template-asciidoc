# Some Remarks

The file `logo.png` is the same as `logo-zimera.png` by intention. Just change one or both file with yours. The file `logo.png` is meant as the book logo (let's say, you may use Rust logo if you make Rust book, Go logo if you make Go book, etc). The file `logo-zimera.png` is meant as the organization logo (your company, your community, whatever).
